# DMSuite
Some resources I have made for DMing dungeons and dragons. 
This is largely coded in JS with some pretty crappy CSS which will be updated as I have more time. I plan on adding the following. A lot of the individual parts are in their own repositories but I am making this one to keep them all together. Eventually I plan on integrating PHP/SQL but who knows. 

Oneshot Generator (Prototype Done)

Initiative Tracker (Prototype Done)

Tavern Generator (Prototype Done)

NPC Generator (in progress)

Loot Generator

Random Encounter Generator

NPC Tracker (will need to use SQL for this ew) (Shows which quest lines are given by which NPCs, Which NPCs run shops, where each NPC is located, which player has met which NPC etc...) (This one will take a hot minute to make lmao)

Some more notes

Do I know everything could be optimized using SQL databases? Yes

Are JS arrays innefective for what I'm doing? Also Yes

Will I not make the SQL database until I absolutely have to and make my life harder? Yes for a third time. 

Anyways if you are reading this I hope you enjoy.
